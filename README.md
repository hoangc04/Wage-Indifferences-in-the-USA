# Wage-Indifferences-in-the-USA

This project analyzes and explores racial and gender inequalities in the United States based on average wages, racial groups, levels of education, and gender. By researching these inequalities, we determine whether racial groups are disadvantaged in the workforce or equally compensated, based on varying similar variables. Understanding this problem will help address racial inequalities and discriminations in the working force. 

Research Questions:
1. Does a higher level of educational attainment contribute to median and average wages? Is this growth exponential or is there a preferred mnimum level of education?
2. What is the significant different, if any, in wages between Black and White men and women? Does gender affect wages and income between individuals?
3. Is there a significant difference in wages between Black and White individuals in the USA? How do racial difference play a part in income differences in addition to levels of education and gender?
